# handwritten_digits_classification
Handwritten Digits Classification using Feedforward Neural Network with keras.
Dataset : MNIST handwritten data.
The Dataset can be included with import mnist or can be downloaded from this url http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

You may have to change the path to the data training and testing file in the code
To compile the code in linux environment system type - python digit_classification.py

This is the most basic implmentation of keras library
